# Dictionary-Python-Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other data types that hold only a single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair. Key-Value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimised. 
 In Python, a dictionary can be created by placing a sequence of elements within curly {} braces, separated by ‘comma’. Dictionary holds pairs of values, one being the Key and the other corresponding pair element being its Key:value. Values in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be duplicated, whereas keys can’t be repeated and must be immutable.
